Moores's law:

Processing power doubles every 18 months.
Current: No. of cores doubles every 18 months.

Kilo = thousand (10^3) 
Mega = million (10^6) 
Giga = billion (10^9) 
Tera = trillion (10^12) 
Peta = 10^15
Exa = 10^18

Python
======

Two's complement is used.

Python integer: 4 bytes

Python - larger integers can be stored and will automatically be stored using more bytes.

Python real numbers use 64 bits.

	N bits integer part, M bits in fractional part

Base 10 scientific notation:

	0.2345e-18= 0.2345 × 10−18 = 0.0000000000000000002345

	Mantissa: 0.2345, Exponent: −18


Binary floating point numbers:
	Example: Mantissa: 0.101101, Exponent: −11011 means: 

	0.101101 = 1(2−1) + 0(2−2) + 1(2−3) + 1(2−4) + 0(2−5) + 1(2−6)
	= 0.703125 (base 10)

	−11011= −1(2^4)+ 1(2^3)+ 0(2^2)+ 1(2^1)+ 1(2^0)= −27(base10) So the number is
	0.703125 × 2−27 ≈ 5.2386894822120667 ×10−9


Python float is 8 bytes with IEEE standard (754) representation. 53 bits for mantissa and 11 bits for exponent (64 bits = 8 bytes). We can store 52 binary bits of precision.

	2^-52 ≈ 2.2 × 10−16 =⇒ roughly 15 digits of precision.

Note: storage and arithmetic is done in base 2 Converted to base 10 only when printed!


- The np.reshape method can go through data in either order: column or row

- The np.flatten method converts an N-dim array to a 1-dimensional one




=================
Version control
=================

Server-client model: (ex SVN, CVS)
	Original style, still widely used (e.g. CVS, Subversion) One central repository on server.
	Developers’ workflow (simplified!):
		• Check out a working copy,
		• Make changes, test and debug,
		• Check in (commit) changes to repository (with comments).
		This creates new version number.
		• Run an update on working copy to bring in others’
		changes.

	The system keeps track of diffs from one version to the next (and info on who made the changes, when, etc.)
	A changeset is a collection of diffs from one commit.

	Only the server has the full history. The working copy has:
		• Latest version from repository (from last checkout, commit, or update)
		• Your local changes that are not yet committed. Note:
		• You can retrieve older versions from the server.
		• Can only commit or update when connected to server.
		• When you commit, it will be seen by anyone else who does an update from the repository.

	Often there are trunk and branches subdirectories.


Distributed version control:

	Git uses a distributed model:
		- git commit commits to your clone’s .git directory.
		• git push sends your recent changesets to another clone by default: the one you cloned from (e.g. bitbucket),
		but you can push to any other clone (with write permission).
		• git fetch pulls changesets from another clone
		by default: the one you cloned from (e.g. bitbucket)
		• git merge applies changesets to your working copy



	Advantages of distributed model:
		• You can commit changes, revert to earlier versions, examine history, etc. without being connected to server.
		• Also without affecting anyone else’s version if you’re working collaboratively. Can commit often while debugging.
		- No problem if server dies, every clone has full history.


		For collaboration will still need to push or fetch changes eventually and git merge may become more complicated.




Bash
-----


1. Sort by size:
ls -latSh shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins 

ls -l | sort -k 5nr : Sort on the 5th column 

ls -l | sort -g -k 5 -r


ls -lS

2. Find the largest file in a directory: 
		ls -Sh shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins  | head -n 1 

3. Find the count of files and folder in the directory

count=`ls -l |wc -l | awk '{$1=$1;print}'`
echo "the number of files in the folder is $count" > file_count.txt


4. Find the count of files in the directory

	find ../ -type f -maxdepth 1 |wc -l | awk '{$1=$1;print}'


5. Find the count of directory in the directory

	find ../ -type d -maxdepth 1 |wc -l | awk '{$1=$1;print}'



6. List the largest file in the folder shell-novice/shell- lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins, print its name, then copy it a new folder called largest.

	echo cp $(ls -S | head -1) ./largest

7. Count the number of files and directories in a given folder.
Generate a new file with the text: “the number of files in
the folder is xx”.

	echo The number of the files is $(ls | wc -w) > blah.txt

8. Write a bash script/loop to create a file that contains the
second last line of all pdb files available in a folder

	for filename in *.pdb
	do
	tail -2 $filename | head -1 >> tt.txt Done

9. In a folder containing 10 files, write a bash script to
prepend the name of each file with the year it was
created.
	for filename in *.pdb; do echo mv $filename $(ls -lT $filename | cut -w -f 9)-$filename; done


10. What does this command do: cut -d, -f 2 animals.csv | sort | uniq –c? animals.csv is in shell-novice/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts

	2012-11-05,deer,5
	2012-11-05,rabbit,22
	2012-11-05,raccoon,7
	2012-11-06,rabbit,19
	2012-11-06,deer,2
	2012-11-06,fox,4
	2012-11-07,rabbit,16
	2012-11-07,bear,1

11. You have a set of 20 text files and would like to concatenate them into one super text file.
	for filename in *.pdb do
		echo ${filename}
		cat ${filename} >> total.pdb
	done

12. Write a script that prints the name of the file with the longest name in a given directory.

	for line in $(ls); do echo ${#line} ${line} >> namelen.txt; done
	cat namelen.txt | sort | head -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 1

Python
=======

1. Every “variable” is really just a pointer to some object. You can reset it to point to some other object at will.
So variables don’t have “type” (e.g. integer, float, string). (But the objects they currently point to do.)



2. >>> x = 3.4
>>> print id(x), type(x) # id() returns memory
8645588 <type ’float’>



3. Note: Object of type ’list’ has a method ’append’ that changes the object.


4. integers and floats are immutable


5. from numpy import sqrt

6. Multiplication repeats:
	>>> x = [2., 3.] >>> 2*x
	[2.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0]

7. Addition concatenates:
	>>> y = [5., 6.] >>> x+y
	[2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0]

8. Numpy arrays use component-wise multiplication.

9. Unlike lists, all elements of an np.array have the same type

10. Can explicitly state desired data type:
	x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=complex) >>> print x
	[ 1.+0.j, 2.+0.j, 3.+0.j]

11. NumPy arrays for vectors and matrices 

12. For Linear algebra, may instead want to use numpy.matrix: 
	>>> A = np.matrix([[1.,2], [3,4], [5,6]]) 

13. Matlab style (as a string that is converted):
	>>> A = np.matrix("1.,2; 3,4; 5,6") >>> A
	matrix([[1., 2.], [3., 4.],
	[5., 6.]])

14. For linear algebra matrix may be easier (and more like Matlab), but vectors need two subscripts!

15. For most other uses, arrays more natural, e.g.
>>> x = np.linspace(0., 3., 100) # 100 points >>> y = x**5 - 2.*sqrt(x)*cos(x) # 100 values >>> plot(x,y)
np.linspace returns an array, which is what is needed here. We will always use arrays.

16. The rank of an array is the number of subscripts it takes:  
	This is not the rank of the matrix in the linear algebra sense (dimension of the column space)!

	A two dimensional matrix has rank = 2

	Scalars have rank 0: z = np.array(7.) 


	NumPy arrays of any dimension are supported, e.g. rank 3:
		>>> T = np.ones((2,2,2)) 
		>>> T
		array([[[1., 1.], [1., 1.]],
		[[1., 1.], [1., 1.]]])

		>>> T[0,0,0] 1.0

17. Linear algebra with NumPy

	>>> A = np.array([[1., 2.], [3, 4]]) 
	>>> A
	array([[1., 2.],
	[3., 4.]])

	>>> b = np.dot(A, np.array([8., 9.])) >>> b
	array([ 26., 60.])

	Now solve Ax = b:
	>>> from numpy.linalg import solve 

	>>> solve(A,b)
	array([ 8., 9.])



	from numpy.linalg import eig

	>>> eig(A) # returns a tuple (evals,evecs)
	(array([-0.37228132, 5.37228132]),
	array([[-0.82456484, -0.41597356], [ 0.56576746, -0.90937671]]))

	>>> evals, evecs = eig(A) # unpacks tuple

	>>> evals
	array([-0.37228132, 5.37228132])

	>>> evecs
	array([[-0.82456484, -0.41597356],
	[ 0.56576746, -0.90937671]])



18. Formating
	f-string format


19. Quadrature (numerical integration)

	from scipy.integrate import quad

	Estimate Integrate [x = 0 to 2] 𝑥 d𝑥= 8/3

	>>> quad(lambda x: x**2, 0., 2.) (2.666666666666667, 2.960594732333751e-14)

	returns (value, error estimate).


20. Write a function to calculate the exponential using the exponential series
	• The function should take the number of terms of the series as an argument, use default of 100
	• Check the convergence of the series



21. Exponential series code: refer to

Fortran
----------

print *, ...: The * means no special format specified As a result all available digits of z will be printed.

First declaration of variables then executable statements 

• implicit none means all variables must be declared

• 3.d0means 3 × 100 in double precision (8 bytes) 
• 2.d-1 means 2 × 10−1 = 0.2


The statement
    implicit none
means all variables must be explicitly declared.


- parameter used to indicate a variable value not to be changed

- dimension(n) :: x, y means these are arrays of length n. 


Data types for the most part there will be only three basic types of data you will
have to deal with, integers, floating point numbers and characters. In fortran
these data types are declared as

integer 
	exact whole numbers (-3, 0, 5 234), usually stored in 4 bytes

real 
	inexact representation of decimal numbers (3.1415, 27.2, 1.e23). Usually stored as 4 bytes, good for about 6-9 significant digits, ranges from
about 10−38–1038

double precision 
	same as real but much larger range and precision.
	Usually stored as 8 bytes, good for about 15-17 significant digits, ranges
	from about 10−308–10308. You can get more precision than this but you
	should have a good reason.

character, character*n 
	either a single character or a string of characters of length n.


logical
	Boolean

Constant and Variable names A constant or variable can have any name with
up to 32 characters (To play it safe though, Standard Fortran allows only
6 characters). The name must start with a letter, but can have most of the


Booleans: .true. Comparisons:

< or .lt. > or .gt. == or .eq.

Examples:
.false.
<= or .le. >= or .ge. /= or .ne.
if ((i >= 5) .and. (i < 12)) then
if (((i .lt. 5) .or. (i .ge. 12)) .and. & (i .ne. 20)) then

Note: & is the Fortran continuation character. Statement continues on next line.



Functions:
	Functions take some input arguments and return a single value. 

	Usage: y = f(x) or z = g(x,y)


	Should be declared as external with the type of value returned: 

	real(kind=8), external :: f



	function input variable 


	real(kind=8), intent(in) :: x


	z = f(y)


Subroutines:

	Subroutines have arguments, each of which might be for input or output or both.
	
	Usage: call sub1(x,y,z,a,b)

	Can specify the intent of each argument, e.g.

	real(kind=8), intent(in) :: x,y 
	real(kind=8), intent(out) :: z 
	real(kind=8), intent(inout) :: a,b


	specifies that x, y are passed in and not modified,
	z may not have a value coming in but will be set by sub1, a, b are passed in and may be modified.
	After this call, z, a, b may all have changed.



	call fsub(y,z)


String:
	character(len=10) :: my_string
    
    my_string = 'Hello'


Arrays:
	x = (/10.,20.,30./)

	print *, "x**2 + y = " ->> component wise operation


	print *, sqrt(y) ! componentwise


	print *, dot_product(x,y) ! scalar product


	program arrayops
		implicit none
		real(kind=8), dimension(3,2) :: a
		...
		! create a as 3x2 array:
		A = reshape((/1,2,3,4,5,6/), (/3,2/))


	Fortran is case insensitive: A = a


	Reshape fills array by columns


	real(kind=8), dimension(3,2) :: a 
	real(kind=8), dimension(2,3) :: b 
	real(kind=8), dimension(3,3) :: c
	integer :: i

	print *, "a = " do i=1,3
	print *, a(i,:) enddo
	
	b = transpose(a) 
	c = matmul(a,b)


Linear system:
	LAPACK underhood library subroutine


	Rank 1 arrays have a single index, for example: real(kind=8) :: x(3)
	real(kind=8), dimension(3) :: x


Provide user customized indexing
	real(kind=8) :: x(0:2), y(4:6), z(-2:0)
	
These are all arrays of length 3 and this would be a valid assignment: y(5) = z(-2)


Dynamic memory allocation:
	Fortran 90 allows dynamic memory allocation.


	real(kind=8) dimension(:), allocatable :: x 
	real(kind=8) dimension(:,:), allocatable :: a

	allocate(x(10)) 
	allocate(a(30,10))
	deallocate(x) 
	deallocate(a)


	If you might run out of memory, use optional argument stat to return the status...

	allocate(a(30000,10000), stat=alloc_error)


Fortran bugs

	Debugging segmentation faults can be difficult.
	Tip: Compile using -fbounds-check flag of gfortran.
	This catches some cases when you try to access an array out of bounds.



size() to find the size of a variable


Fortran modules:

	module <MODULE-NAME>
	! Declare variables

	contains
	! Define subroutines or functions

	end module <MODULE-NAME>

	A program/subroutine/function can use this module:

	program <NAME>

	use <MODULE-NAME>
	! Declare variables

	! Executable statements

	end program <NAME>

	Can also specify a list of what variables/subroutines/functions from module to be used.


	program <NAME>
		use <MODULE-NAME>, only: <LIST OF SYMBOLS> ! Declare variables
		! Executable statements
	end program <NAME>



	the module must be compiled before any subroutine or program that uses it!


	global variables to be mentioned in the module

	save keyword to save once a subroutine/function updates the global variable





==========
MakeFiles
==========
	

	target: dependencies
	<TAB> command(s) to make target


	Important to use tab character, not spaces!! Warning: Some editors replace tabs with spaces!


	Typing “make target” means:
		1 Make sure all the dependencies are up to date (those that are also targets)
		2 If target is older than any dependency, recreate it using the specified commands.

	These rules are applied recursively!


	echo means print out the string.
	@echo means print out the string but don’t print the command.
